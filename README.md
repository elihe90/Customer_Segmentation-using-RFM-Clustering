# Customer_Segmentation-using-RFM-Clustering
Customer segmentation is the process of separating customers into groups on the basis of their shared behavior or other attributes.
The groups should be homogeneous within themselves and should also be heterogeneous to each other.
The overall aim of this process is to identify high-value customer base i.e. customers that have the highest growth potential or are the most profitable.
